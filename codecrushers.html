	<b><u>The Importance of Environmental Sustainability</u></b><br>
		When we’re feeling stressed or out of touch, many of us instinctively go for walks. We search for forests, parks, beaches, and country
		roads to feel more at peace connected to nature. Given that fact, it’s no surprise that human well-being is intrinsically linked to the health
		of the environment. About 24% of global human deaths arecaused—directly or indirectly—by avoidable environmental factors.To live long and healthy 
		lives,we need and deserve unpolluted air to breathe, clean water to drink, and to live in places free of toxic substances.<br><br>

		As the global population grows and we begin to experience the long-term consequences 
		of excessive energy use and industrial growth, we must prevent further damage. It is our job to ensure our future 
		generations have healthy places to live and minimize our damage to the earth’s biodiverse ecosystems. For businesses, sustainability means
		running a business through sustainable practices and securing future growth potential without causing too much damage to the environment.

	An environment is generally defined as the surroundings or conditions in which a person, animal or plant survives or operates. From this, it must be
	relatively easy for one to comprehend its importance in the famed cycle of life.
<br><br>
	Our environment is constantly changing, and as our environment changes so does the need to become increasingly aware of the environmental issues that
	are causing these changes. With a massive increase in natural disasters, warming and cooling periods, and different types of weather patterns, people
	need to be a lot more cautious with the way they lead their lives in conjunction with the types of environmental issues our planet is facing.

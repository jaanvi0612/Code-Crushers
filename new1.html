<p>
	Environmental issues are the harmful effects of human activities on the environment. These include pollution, overpopulation, waste disposal,climate 
	change, global warming, the greenhouse effect, etc. 
	Various environment protection programs are being practised at the individual, organizational and government levels with the aim of establishing a 
	balance between man and the Global warming is the phenomenon of gradual increase in the average temperature of earth . It is caused by the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, CFCs etc. into the atmosphere.environment.<br><br>

	<h1><b><u>Climate Change</u></b></h1>
	<img src="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Desktop\Pics\climate.jpeg" height="250px" length="250px" align="left">
<p>
	Climate change is a great concern in today’s scenario. This problem has surfaced in the last few decades. Greenhouse gases are the major cause of 
	climate change. Environmental changes have several destructive impacts such as the melting of glaciers, change in seasons, epidemics, etc.
<br><br>
	Climate change is directly contributing to humanitarian emergencies from heatwaves, wildfires, floods, tropical storms and hurricanes and they are 
	increasing in scale, frequency and intensity.

	<h1><b><u>Global Warming</u></b></h1>
	<img src="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Desktop\Pics\Capture23.jpeg" height="250px" length="250px" align="right">
<p>
	Global warming is the long-term heating od earths surface observed since the pre-industrial period(between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities
	primarily fossil fuels burning which increase heat-trapping green house gas levels in earth's atmosphere.
<br><br>
	Global warming is the phenomenon of gradual increase in the average temperature of earth . It is caused by the release of greenhouse gases like 
	carbon dioxide, methane, CFCs etc. into the atmosphere.<br><br>
	<h1><b><u>Ozone Layer Depletion</u></b></h1>
	<img src="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Desktop\Pics\ozone.jpeg" height="250px" length="250px" align="left">
<p>
	The ozone layer is the common term for the high concentration of ozone that is found in the stratosphere around 15–30km above the earth's surface.
<br><br>
	The ozone layer filters UV light from the sun. Without the ozone layer, UV rays from the sun would be too strong for human and plant life to thrive.
	Too much exposure to UV rays can cause sunburn, skin cancer, and glaucoma. Crops and ecological processes would also be affected.
</p>

	<h1><b><u>Water Pollution</u></b></h1>
	<img src="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Desktop\Pics\water.jpeg" height="250px" length="250px" align="right">
<p>
	Water pollution is the contamination of water with substances or energy that make it unsafe for human consumption or for the environment.
	Water pollution, the release of substances into subsurface groundwater or into lakes, streams, rivers, estuaries, and oceans to the point that the 
	substances interfere with beneficial use of the water or with the natural functioning of ecosystems.
<br><br>
	Water pollution is the addition of substances or energy forms that directly or indirectly alter the nature of the water body in such a manner that 
	negatively affects its legitimate uses.
</p>
<br>
	<h1><b><u>Air Pollution</u></b></h1>
	<img src="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Desktop\Pics\air.jpeg" height="250px" length="250px" align="left">
<p>
	Air pollution is contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the natural 
	characteristics of the atmosphere. Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires are common sources of air 
	pollution.
<br><br>
	Air pollution exposures include cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory diseases, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and reproductive, neurological, 
	and immune system disorders.
</p>
<br><br>
	<h1><b><u>Solid Waste Management</u></b></h1>
	<img src="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Desktop\Pics\solid.jpeg" height="250px" length="250px" align="right">
<p>
	Solid waste contamination occurs when solid wastes are present in the environment (air, water, and soil), making them less suitable or unsuitable 
	for living creatures.
<br><br>
	The term solid waste management mainly refers to the complete process of collecting, treating and disposing of solid wastes.In the waste management
	process, the wastes are collected from different sources and are disposed of. This process includes collection, transportation, treatment, analysis
	and disposal of waste.

	<h1><b><u>Deforestration</u></b></h1>
	<img src="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Desktop\Pics\deforestration.jpeg" height="250px" length="250px" align="left">
<p>
	Deforestation is the purposeful clearing of forested land. Throughout history and into modern times, forests have been razed to make space for 
	agriculture and animal grazing, and to obtain wood for fuel, manufacturing, and construction. Deforestation has greatly altered landscapes around 
	the world.
<br><br>
	Deforestation is cutting down a large number of trees and clearing out forest areas. The various reasons behind these human activities are increasing the 
	space for human usage like logging or wood extraction, agricultural expansion, infrastructure expansion etc.
</p>
<br><br>
	<h1><b><u>Overpopulation</u></b></h1>
	<img src="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Desktop\Pics\population.jpeg" height="250px" length="250px" align="right">
<p>
	Overpopulation is a phenomenon that occurs when a population becomes too large for its environment to support. This can happen when the number of 
	people exceeds the amount of available resources, such as food, water, shelter, and transportation.
<br><br>
	Overpopulation is a major problem in India, as the country's population is growing at an unsustainable rate. The population is expected to exceed 
	1.5 billion by 2030, and 2 billion by 2050.

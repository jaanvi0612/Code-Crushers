<b>Water management is the responsible use and conservation of water resources
to ensure a sustainable future. It involves:</b><br> 
<b>1.Efficient use:</b> Making the most of water supplies for various purposes, such as agriculture<br> 
<b>2.Minimizing damage:</b> Reducing the risk of harm to life and property from flooding<br> 
<b>3.Safeguarding the environment:</b> Mitigating water-related hazards and protecting the environment<br> 
<b>4.Improving water quality:</b> Replenishing depleted underground aquifers to improve water quality and availability<br>

<p>Water management is a process of developing, optimizing and planning of water resources 
via many practices which are defined by many policies and regulations. 
With the increase in the population which has been doubled to over 6 billion people from 1900,
the use of water has popped up to 600%. According to the statistics, the health of people is threatened by
inadequate access to clean water for drinking and sanitation.

<h2><u>WATER CONSERVATION METHOD</u></h2>
<h2><p><b>1. Greywater Recycling Systems:</b></p></h2>
<img src="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Desktop\Pics\watergrey.jpeg" align="right" height="300px" length="300px" >
<p>
The water used in most building structures is thought of in terms of clear clean water coming in, and sewage or
black water going out.However, greywater is something that is in between that. In the domestic setting, greywater 
systems collect water from sources like baths, hand basins, and showers. 
<br><br>
This collected water is reused for washing machines, toilet flushing, and other external usages. The main idea behind 
greywater recovery is simply getting the most out of the water through its efficient reuse.
</p>
<br><br>
<h2><p><b>2. Rainwater harvesting:</b></p></h2>
<img src="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Desktop\Pics\rain.jpeg" align="left" height="300px" width="40%" ><br>
<p>
Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is the collection and storage of rain,rather than allowing it to run off. Rainwater is collected
from a roof-like surface and redirected to a tank, cistern, deep pit (well, shaft, or borehole), aquifer, or a reservoir 
with percolation,so that it seeps down and restores the ground water.
<br><br>
Rainwater harvesting differs from stormwater harvesting as the runoff is typically collected from roofs and other area 
surfaces for storage and subsequent reuse. Its uses include watering gardens, livestock,irrigation, domestic use with proper
treatment, and domestic heating. The harvested water can also be committed to longer-term storage or groundwater recharge.
</p>
<br>
<h2><p><b>3.Drip irrigation</b></p></h2>

<p>
Drip systems apply water and minerals evenly across crops, thus helping to reduce wastage and increase crop yields.It 
involves the application of water at a determined rate to the root zone of crops. This significantly reduces water run loss
through deep percolation or evaporation.
<br><br>
Drip irrigation systems distribute water through a network of valves, pipes, tubing, and emitters. Depending on how well
designed, installed, maintained, and operated it is, a drip irrigation system can be more efficient than other types of 
irrigation systems, such as surface irrigation or sprinkler irrigation.

<h2><p><b>4.Water metres</b></p></h2>
<img src="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Desktop\Pics\watermeter.jpeg" align="left" height="300px" width="40%" ><br>
<p>
Water metering involves using a device known as a water meter to measure the volume of water used by a residential or 
commercial building supplied with public water. Water metering also determines flow at a certain point in the water system. 
<br><br>
Water metering is a way to measure water usage. This guide will explore water metering in detail, including why and how it’s
used, the common types of metering devices, and the costs, benefits, and problems associated with this measurement of water
use. 
<br><br>
<h2><p><b>5.Efficient taps</b></p></h2>
<img src="C:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Desktop\Pics\tap.jpeg" align="right" height="300px" length="300px">
<p>
Water efficient taps aim to provide high performance while reducing the amount of water used. We recommend that a qualified
plumber carries out or supervises any improvements.
<br><br>
A large bit of water consumption comes from guest bathrooms and public washrooms. And the cost of water is only going up,
mainly due to rising energy costs.
<br><br>
You can retrofit tap aerators inside existing taps. These devices mix air with the water, producing the same force of flow.
Costing as little as £5 per unit, you'll see a return on your investment in about three months.
